          <h2 class="title">Welcome!</h2>
          <p>
            In May 2022, some UBC Computer Science (CS) graduate students
            distributed surveys to the other students in the department to
            determine how well students were being supported by their current
            stipends. This explainer uses the survey data, and data from
            government and university websites to demonstrate the current cost
            of living situation in Vancouver (as of Dec 2022), see how students
            are being supported, and compare your own budget to that of an
            average CS graduate student. Scroll through the article for more
            information!

          <h2 class="title">
            So what expenses does a UBC CS grad student have?
          </h2>
          <p>
            Focusing on the basic expenses of a CS graduate student, this shows
            the average proportion of their expenses separated into housing,
            food, social activities, health, utilies, and commuting
            expenditures.
          </p>

        <section class="step">
          <h2 class="title">How can we calculate inflation in Vancouver?</h2>
          The consumer price index (CPI) is a common econcomic metric used to
          measure the inflation rate in a certain economic market (such as
          Vancouver). It is a proportional metric used to compare prices of an
          item now to the price of the same item some years ago. For example, if
          a banana cost $2 in 2022, but now costs $4 in 2022. The CPI for the
          banana would be: 200. Note, there are not units for this metric.
        </section>
        <section class="step">
          <h2 class="title">Inflation Rate at British Columbia</h2>
          <p>
            Here we have the overaall CPI for British Columbia since 2016. The
            CPI calculated here is based on comparing prices of items to their
            original price in 2002. The visualization here depicts the overal
            upward trend of CPI indicating that inflation has been increasing
            since 2002.
          </p>

        <section class="step">
          <h2 class="title">The 12-month % change</h2>
          <p>
            An overall change of inflation over the course of 2 decades is not
            surprising. But let's compare the CPI change from year to year. In
            this visualization, we have how CPI has changed compared to the
            previous year. If you look at 2022, this rate is strikingly fast
            compared to previous years.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section class="step">
          <h2 class="title">Components</h2>
          <p>
            Let's look at the previous year a little most closely. In this graph
            every line represents the change in CPI from October 2021 to
            September 2022. We can calculate CPI for different components, such
            as food and hosuing. Looks like in August of 2022, clothing was
            overall less expensive than in August of 2021.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section class="step">
          <h2 class="title">Housing!</h2>
          <p>
            But housing has one of the highest 12-month CPI over the last year.
            A CPI of 8.26% means that if your rent was 1600$ last year, it will
            be
            <strong>1732$</strong>
            this year. This is particularly concerning for graduate students
            since housing is the largest monthly expense that students have.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section class="step">
          <h2 class="title">Food &amp; Transport</h2>
          <p>
            The price of food and transport has also risen. This means that if
            you bought a steak (<span>ðŸ¥©</span>) for 10$ last year, it will cost
            you 11$ this year!
          </p>
          <p>
            Transport (ðŸš—) has the the overall highest 12-month CPI. Transport
            is a relatively smaller portion of the average CS students' monthly
            budget. However, given these rapid increase
            <strong>you cannot choose to live too far away</strong>.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section class="step">
          <h2 class="title">OK. Well what about CS grad student funding?</h2>
          Each shape you see here depicts one student who filled out the cost of
          living survey. And each shape represents if that student is in a
          masters, Ph.D. or Ph.D.-track program. In this visualization, we are
          looking at how a students basic income (their research assitantship
          (RA-ship) + teaching assistantship (TA-ship)) compares to the number
          of expenses they have.
        </section>

        <section class="step">
          <h2 class="title">Oh no!</h2>
          <p>
            From our survey, the funding of
            <span style="color: #db0b0b; font-weight: bold;">47.5%</span>
            graduate students in UBC CS department cannot offset their basic
            expenses! Each student highlighted in red has more expenses than
            they do income.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section class="step">
          <h2 class="title">With additional support...</h2>
          <div class="scatter-final-content">
            <p>
              Some students receieve additional financial support in terms of
              awards or internships. All students that
              <span style="color: #7e7dfe;">receive this extra support</span>
              can afford all their basic expenses and perhaps even save a little
              on the side.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, there are students are
              <span style="color: #ffa38b;"
                >who still cannot overcome their expenses</span
              >
              because they currently have no extra support available.
            </p>
            <p>
              There are also those with
              <span style="color: #8fbd88;">"just enough"</span> funding, but
              they likely are unable to save as they just meet their basic
              needs.

        <section class="step">
          <h2 class="title">An unsafe feeling.</h2>
          <p>
            88.6% of the respondents to the cost of living survey said they are
            feeling unsafe in current grad stipend amount.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section class="step">
          <h2 class="title">How about you?</h2>
          <p>
            How do your expenses compare to that of an average computer science
            graduate student? Use the sliders to input your own expenses (in $
            CAD) for each category and see how you stack up.

        </section>
        <section class="step">
          <h2 class="title">What about other universities?</h2>
          <p>
            Here we depict how the funding for computer science Ph.D students at
            different universities compares to the cost of living in the city
            that the university is located in. The negative side represnts the
            diferent yearly costs for a student and the positive side represents
            the yearly funding a student receives.

        </section>

        <section class="step">
          <h2 class="title">Does the funding offset the expenses?</h2>
          <p>
            Here we have overlaid the cost of living on top of the income that
            the Ph.D. students receive. In some universities, like MIT, we see
            that students actually earn more than they spend. But in other
            universities, like UBC and McGill, the expenses that students have
            is greater than the income they receive. Boom! After adding the
            <strong>cost of living</strong>, the problem arises!
          </p>

        <section class="step">
          <h2 class="title">Ordering the comparison...</h2>
          <p>
            After ordering the comparison we see that students at UBC have the
            greatest deficit when it comes to their income vs their expenses
            compared to other universities.
